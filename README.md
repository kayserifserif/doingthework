# The Why Tool

i was thinking about how there are core things that are believed amongst my friends and communities, and there are a lot of resources that dig into those values and beliefs, but i'm not good at actually discussing them with my friends. that's led me to not really take a stance on some issues or importantly feel at sea when i talk to people like my parents, who are coming from a place with a very different baseline, and i need to start from scratch and try to explain why i believe in things and persuade them. so i was thinking of a digital tool (or like could also be a prompt for conversation between friends, or a journaling exercise) to help you question and strengthen your beliefs: it'll give a prompt of some stance on an issue, you give your stance or lack of it, and it'll keep asking you why. like how little kids will keep asking why and end up challenging their parents on things likeâ€¦ why is the sky blue?
