      <h1>About this tool</h1>
      <p>It can be difficult to do the work to untangle the complex feelings and thoughts we have about issues in our society. We might not be able to organise our thoughts coherently, or we feel upset about things out of our control, or we have conflicting inner thoughts that we push away because it’s too confusing.</p>
      <p>I built this tool hoping to help facilitate that emotional and intellectual work. The prompts that come up may be ones you agree with, disagree with, or feel conflicted about. The tool isn’t intended to promote particular viewpoints (though my own subjectivity has led to specific wordings), but rather to help you dig into your own beliefs. In addition to helping you question your beliefs, I hope the tool can help you strengthen them too. It can serve as a space for you to lay out your thoughts on issues you have strong opinions on, which you might draw on for conversations with people with differing views. The tool doesn’t have to live only on this website – I like to imagine it alternatively as a conversation framework or journaling exercise too, if you feel so inspired!</p>
      <p>If you have feedback on how this tool can be improved, please do reach out. :)</p>
